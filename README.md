# Welcome to Airport Builder!

Airport Builder is **a simple playground where you can use elements to build various airports** you can think of... maybe even real ones? Like Chicago O'hare? Oh, wait, that's not too easy. You can also use this sandboxes to build other types of airports, such as air bases.

Imagine, you were told to build a model airport for a school project, or you wanted to make a Minecraft airport just for fun. That's where **everyone starts from Scratch**. And the best part? **It's completely free!**

Add elements, such as runways, taxiways and aprons, wherever you want on the map. Any design you can imagineâ€”right in your fingertips.
